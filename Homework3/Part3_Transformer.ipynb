      "I rented I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it's not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn't have much of a plot.\n",

      "\"I Am Curious: Yellow\" is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's bodies.\n",

       "['This usually all sounds a lot better in my head (so forgive me for rambling) I\\'m hardly Tarantino\\'s biggest fan (and will *try* not to stoop to calling him a \\'hack\\'....which is quite hard) I don\\'t like to mock or critique a movie before seeing it. So with cautious hesitation, i walked to the cinema today to watch \\'Inglorious Basterds\\'<br /><br />Now, to call it a \\'rip-off of a rip-off\\' would be unfair here. Tarantino is happy enough to take the title from Enzo Castellari\\'s (less than spectacular) Dirty Dozen clone, but not it\\'s plot points (that, he takes from all other genre of movies) \\'Inglorious\\' opens with a Nazi officer and his lengthy interrogation against a farmer who is hiding Jews in his basement. This is such an anti-climax, in that, it\\'s dialogue is stale, and outcome signposted a mile off. Of course, one of the hidden Jews makes her escape (but more of her later) We (the obviously, easily pleased) audience are treated to the introduction of Lt. Aldo Raine (ha-ha, that name almost sounds like B-movie king ALDO RAY....ha-ha Quentin...keep those \\'tributes\\' coming) and this character is played by none other than Brad (DALLAS) Pitt (sorry, DALLAS was about the only good thing he\\'s ever starred in) and with jaw-jutting, Mr Jolie treats us to a hound-dogged, southern drawled, smirking Nazi-killer. Meanwhile Mr Tarantino forgets that actual grown-ups may be in attendance, so assumes that the teenyboppers won\\'t have heard of the \\'Dirty Dozen\\'?<br /><br />Raines \\'platoon\\' consists of (John Cassavettes looking) blood-thirsty Jewish soldiers, all looking to get the big payback on Adolf Hitler. Tarantino in all his superior knowledge, pays special attention to two of these men, by casting his long time best buddy (and fellow homage-sycophant) Eli Roth (as the baseball bat wielding \\'Bear Jew\\') The other man is called Hugo Stiglitz (and i\\'ll wager more than half the QT fan-boys had never heard this name before this movie) Keep up the good work Tarantino, you\\'ve managed about 6 or 7 \\'hommages\\' so far (in the first 15 minutes) keep adding them, and it may detract from the plot (or lack of?)<br /><br />Anyhow, cutting a long (and extremely boring and protracted) story short, both Raine and his men (the \\'Inglorious Basterds\\') and the sole survivor from chapter one, both have separate plots to kill Hitler at the showing of a Nazi-propaganda movie, in a french cinema (owned by the fore-mentioned survivor, now grown up)<br /><br />More boring (and pointless) conversations follow two and fro, as Pitt mugs away at an audience past caring. And any genuine suspense, leading to the assassination of the most deadly tyrant of all time, is thrown-away by the directors insistence of placing a 1980\\'s David Bowie song in a WWII movie.<br /><br />My problems (and there are many) with this movie, is the re-occurring problem i have with most Tarantino product.....he rarely knows when to either start or stop. I don\\'t need \\'homage\\' after \\'homage\\' to get the *joke* (whatever it may be) I knew of Inglorious Bastards, Enzo Castellari, Aldo Ray, Hugo Stiglitz (and the ultimate crime of the entire movie) Ennio Morricone\\'s haunting score from REVOLVER. I go to the cinema to see the stars.....if the best you can do is the dire Barad Pitt, i\\'ll assume You (Mr Tarantino) are the main draw here? I don\\'t want the audience directing the movie. I pay to see YOUR vision, your ideas, your creativity....NOT how you can patchwork (time and time again) endless scenes from endless movies. It\\'s high time the fan-boys (on IMDb) employed some \\'tough love\\' on your \\'idol\\' (god knows, if you don\\'t....the studios should?)<br /><br />The tired old argument with Tarantino worshippers is \"well, if you can do better...do so\" Let me tell you, if i was a 46 year old director, with the (unfortunate) pull QT has.....i\\'d want to offer YOU a lot more than a warmed up muddled re-hash of better WWII movies than this tripe. The directors he attempts to emulate, made movies so bad by accident, or due to budgetary constraints. It\\'s a cop out, time and time again, to hear his fans campaign his lack of imagination as \\'art\\'. I\\'m sure he\\'s capable of better (but after giving him the benefit of the doubt, once more....and not to mention 2 and a half hours of my life.....) maybe he isn\\'t?']"

       "In a single layer of sliding-window attention, each token can attend to its local neighborhood defined by the window size.\n",
       " When multiple such layers are stacked, the effective context of each token increases because tokens within the window \n",
       " of a higher layer can attend to tokens in the windows of the previous layer. This concept is similar to the idea of\n",
       "  a receptive field in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), where stacking layers increases the receptive field, enabling each neuron to capture more context from the input.\n",
       "\n",
       "Specifically, if a single layer of sliding-window attention covers a context of w tokens, after l layers, the effective context each token can attend to becomes approximately l×w tokens.\n",
